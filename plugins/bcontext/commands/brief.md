Produce a daily brief for the active Bcontext workspace, since $ARGUMENTS (default: 24 hours ago).

Prefer the CLI (`bx`, env `BCONTEXT_*`) if a shell is available; otherwise the `mcp__bcontext__*` tools.

1. `bx changes --since <ts> --limit 200` — collect the raw activity.
2. `bx unblocked --kind task` — what became ready to start.
3. For anything ambiguous, `bx get <node-id>` the specific nodes (don't re-read the whole workspace).

Output (markdown, under 200 words):
- **Shipped** — tasks/bugs that reached done, with `/n/<id>` refs.
- **Decisions** — new or edited decision/adr nodes, one line each.
- **Blockers** — tasks in blocked status or with undone blockers.
- **Newly unblocked** — ready work, ordered by priority.

Every item must carry its `/n/<node_id>` ref so the reader can jump in.
